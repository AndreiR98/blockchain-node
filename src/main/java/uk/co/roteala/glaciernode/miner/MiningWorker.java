     * If the node is not acting as a server for others then it won't directly broadcast to them

     * Lets say D mines a block and it's connected only to B, it will send data to B
     * Then B will broadcast it to C and N, N will broadcast it to A, Not B(because of back sending), A will broadcast to C
     * But C already has the block from B, and thus will not propagate or backsend it anymore
     * Once a block arrives in the mining queue it won't be broadcasted again this way we eliminate infite loops

     *                       F
     * Let's say E mines a block and that broadcast it to F and backsend to B
     * F will backsend to D, D will backsend to B
     * B will Send to D and backsend to N
     * N will send to A, and A to C
     * We can see that B,D,E,F can create an infite loop
     * The catch is to break the loop in F, So F gets the block from E, it will check for peer to broadcast further, if no possible
     * then it will verify the block and confirm the broker.
     * The block will then go to B, and B will send to D, D will send to F, but F already have it
